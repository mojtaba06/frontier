### A starter for front-end projects with gulp

This is a workflow for front-end and ui projects. Works done with this workflow is:
    
- Sass: Watch, compile, add source maps, autoprefix, minify, csscomb and rtl 
- HTML: Use partials, conditions and loops using gulp-file-include
- JS: Concat, uglify and minify js files with seperation of vendor and libraries files.
- Images: Compression
- Fonts: Copy
- Build: Backup source, zip and clear dist
